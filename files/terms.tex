\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Lowess fit} = Stands for \textit{\underline{LO}cally \underline{WE}ighted \underline{S}catterplot \underline{S}moothing}.
    It fits simple models localized to subsets of the data in order to build up a function that describes the deterministic part of the variation in the data, point by point.
    \item \textbf{Degrees of Freedom} = the maximum number of logically independent values, which may vary in a data sample. 
    \item \textbf{Standard deviation} = The interval of one standard deviation of the mean (on each side) in a normal distribution contains 68\% of the data. 2$\sigma$ contains 95\%, and 3$\sigma$ contains 99.7\%.
